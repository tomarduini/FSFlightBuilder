Thank you for your interest in FS Flight Builder

What does this program do?
******************
FS Flight Builder is a utility for general aviation flying that will build flight files for FSX (flt), FSX Steam Edition (flt), and Prepar3D (fxml) based on waypoints and other data either entered manually or imported from SkyVector using the Plain Text Link information.  Among other things, you can select your starting position, aircraft, and VFR or IFR flight plan.

One of the most interesting features of the application is that it includes a Briefing file, added to the aircraft's built-in kneedboard, that will include departure and destination airport information (runways, frequencies, weather, and charts) as well as navigation frequencies along the route.

Have you ever started up flight simulator and thought “where do I want to go today”?  The new Destination Chooser functionality can help to solve that problem.  The screen allows you to enter your departure airport and choose various parameters for your destination (like min and max distance, tower availability, ILS availability, runway length requirements, etc.).

How to install:
***************
Run Setup.exe and simply follow the installation wizard. 
When you run the application for the first time (make sure your flight simulator is not running), it will build the database from your flight sim data.  Be patient.  It could take a few minutes.
It will attempt to locate your flight sim folder and flight plan folders automatically.  If it can't find them, however, you'll need to select them from the options menu.
 
IMPORTANT!
Because FS Flight Builder saves to your Flight Sim directories, it MUST be run in Administrator mode.  To do this, right-click on the desktop icon, select the Compatibility tab, and check the Run as administrator checkbox.
